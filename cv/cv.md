# Summary

I am a computational physicist specializing in numerical and statistical methods, applied to high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) models of the atmosphere. I am particularly interested in implementing and optimizing parallel processing of large, multi-dimensional data, as well as machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian Process (GP) and deep neural networks to better represent the complex dynamics seen in the modelled data.

# Skills

- 15+ years of project experience with `Python`, `C`, and `C++`

- Parallel processing of multi-dimensional data with `C++` (xtensor) and `Julia`

- Statistical analysis with `Numpy`, `Scipy` and `Scikit-learn`

- Data pre-processing with `Pandas`/`Polars` and `Arrow/Parquet`

- Machine learning experience with `Pytorch`[^f1], `Keras` and `Jax`

- Experience with RDBMS with `MongoDB`, `PostgresSQL` and `MariaDB`
